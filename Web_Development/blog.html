		  <p class="quate">When I generated the shellcode, I also cleared the 0x00 byte value from
		the Restricted Characters text box and made sure that the Selected Encoder
		was set to Default Encoder. </p>
		<p>The reason for this is shown in the last two lines
		of the shellcode, where you see the value \x41 eight times. Why is the capital
		letter A being repeated? Simple. We need to be able to dynamically specify
		a PID that needs to be killed, and so we are able to replace the repeated </p>
		<p>A character block with the PID to be killed and pad the rest of the buffer
		with NULL values. If we had used an encoder, then those A values would be
		encoded, and our life would be miserable trying to do a string replacement.
		This way, we can adapt the shellcode on the fly.</p>

			<p class="quate">Once you have entered a valid username and password, the server
				will allow you to use a full set of commands for transferring files, changing
				directories, querying the filesystem, and much more.</p>
				<p>Since the USER and PASS
				commands are only a small subset of the FTP server’s full capabilities, let’s
				throw in a couple of commands to test for some more bugs once we are
				authenticated.</p>
				<p>Take a look at Listing 9-2 for some additional commands
